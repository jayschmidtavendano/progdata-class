### Introduction
My name is **Jason R. Schmidt Avendaño**. I was born in Las Vegas and have moved around as a military child my entire life. I happily represent my fellow LatinX and LGBTQIA+ communities as a Panamanian who speaks fluent Spanish. I am often spending time outside of work: 
  * Playing with my dog
  * Rollerblading
  * Paddle Boarding
  * Singing

I am a professional singer who works as a cantor at a local church as well as a student professional in the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay. 

###Research
I am a first-year graduate student in the CNS program at *The University of South Florida* studying *Cognitive Neuroscience*. I earned my bachelor degrees in Psychology and Vocal Performance from Stetson University. My research interests lie at the crossroads between music cognition and language comprehension. I am specifically interested in studying the Neuro-Cognitive overlap of prediction for musicians and non-musicians.

**Research Interests**:  
  * Broadly interested in the neuro-cognitive overlap between music and language.
  * Investigating musical factors that impact the network and function of the brain, specifically auditory and sensory perception, language comprehension, and emotional response.
  * Understanding the pathway and importance of music research’s ability to continually innovate the
healthcare, public policy, and community sectors.
  * Identifying and incorporating factors of diversity, equity, and inclusion into all facets of the
STEM field and music cognition and perception research.
