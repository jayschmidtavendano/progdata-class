### Introduction
My name is **Jason R. Schmidt Avendaño**. I was born in Las Vegas and have moved around as a military child my entire life. I happily represent my fellow LatinX and LGBTQIA+ communities as a Panamanian who speaks fluent Spanish. I am often spending time outside of work: 
  * Playing with my dog
  * Rollerblading
  * Paddle Boarding
  * Singing

I am a professional singer who works as a cantor at a local church as well as a student professional in the Master Chorale of Tampa Bay. 

I am a first-year graduate student in the CNS program at *The University of South Florida* studying *Cognitive Neuroscience*. I earned my bachelor degrees in Psychology and Vocal Performance from Stetson University. My research interests lie at the crossroads between music cognition and language comprehension. I am specifically interested in studying the Neuro-Cognitive overlap of prediction for musicians and non-musicians.
